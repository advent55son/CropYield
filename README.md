Abstract:

Agriculture plays a vital role in improving our countries economy. As it contributes about 17% to the total GDP and provides employment to over 60% of the population. Hence we can say that agriculture can be backbone of all business in our country. With being rapid increase of population, the need for satisfactory level of crop production increases with decreased amount of agricultural lands and in cost-effective way. We can improve agriculture by using machine learning techniques which are applied on farming sector. This paper presents a comprehensive review of crop yield prediction and disease detection. For successful production of crops we must ensure whether a particular crop will yield in particular soil and weather condition. And also if crop is not yielding properly, that means it must have some disease.One major effect on low crop yield is disease caused by bacteria, virus and fungus. Machine learning methods can be used for diseases identification because it mainly apply on data themselves and gives priority to outcomes of certain task. The decision is focused entirely on different input factors, such as type of crop, time/month of harvest, type of plant required for the crop, type of harvest, and authorized rental budget. This paper cover the machine learning algorithms like Random forest, KNN, Artificial neural network, Support vector machine, Bayesian that are implemented in crop yield prediction and find out the best algorithm that is efficient for farmers. The prime focus of this paper is on improving the usability of agricultural services by providing a better tool which helps in solving many agriculture and farmers problems.
